John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. the bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200 and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

Implement a tip calculator using the objects and loops 
Create an object with an array for the bill values
Add a method to calculate the tip 
This method should include a loop to iterate over the paid bills and do the tip calculation 
An output creates 
1.	A new array containing all tips 
2.	A new array contain final paid amounts which is the tip and bill 

Hint: start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
